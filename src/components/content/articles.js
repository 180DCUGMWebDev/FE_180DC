        Impostor syndrome is known as a condition where one has the feeling of being inadequate and
        a fraud despite a reputation for success at work. Statistics said that almost 70% have had
        impostor syndrome. According to Dr. Tewfik through Harvard Business Review article, people
        with impostor syndrome adopted a more other-focused orientation in their social
        interactions. This leads them to be rated as more interpersonally effective. This creates
        some advantages that we&apos;ll discuss further.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the effects of having impostor syndrome could lead to several insecurities and low
        self-esteem issues, it is found that they can make you more adept in building relationships.
        Essentially, having impostor thoughts make you more ‚Äúpeople oriented‚Äù where generally you
        would be more attuned to other people&apos;s perceptions and feelings leading to higher rate
        of likability. For example, one sample shows that doctors in training who had more-frequent
        impostor thoughts were significantly better at handling interpersonal-skill with patients,
        making them having higher ratings in hospitality. In addition, Dr. Tewfik also does not find
        that impostor syndrome affects their performance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even so, it is undeniable that having impostor syndrome would create low self-esteem
        thoughts. The notion that persisted is that people with the syndrome would most likely be
        stressed out due to the negative thoughts, lowering their performance in the way. However,
        there&apos;s no dated empirical evidence that the thoughts could degrade performance.
        Moreover, psychologists often point to something called the Yerkes-Dodson stress performance
        curve, which shows that a few nerves improve performance. Thus, it is an open question
        whether or not the right amount of impostor thoughts could manifest just enough motivation
        to do tasks very well.
        <br />
        <br />
        So, should we all jumpstart our impostor-induced thoughts?
        <br />
        <br />
        As tempting as that may seem, Dr. Tewfik doesn&apos;t recommend intentionally inducing
        impostor thoughts. There are simply better ways to help form better, stronger interpersonal
        relationships. The idea behind this research is to create validation that these thoughts
        won&apos;t hinder you from any performance. Yes, it is a common struggle to have, but you
        shouldn&apos;t compound the stress that comes with them by thinking self-limiting beliefs
        when it comes to establishing work performance. Especially because it is mainly triggered by
        new, foreign experiences, it is not going to affect your performance rate-at least by
        previous studies.
